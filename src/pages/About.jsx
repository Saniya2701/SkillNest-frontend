                Our Founding Story
              </h1>
              <p className="text-base font-medium text-richblack-300 lg:w-[95%]">
                SkillNest was born from my personal journey as a student trying 
                to navigate the overwhelming world of online learning. I struggled 
                with scattered resources, outdated content, and the constant feeling
                that quality education was either too expensive or out of reach. 
                I knew there had to be a better way — a smarter, more accessible 
                space where students could truly grow.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base font-medium text-richblack-300 lg:w-[95%]">
                That belief turned into SkillNest — a platform built for learners 
                like us. A place where education is flexible, practical, and designed 
                to build real skills for the real world. Because I believe no dream
                should be limited by access, and every student deserves the 
                opportunity to unlock their full potential.

                Our vision for SkillNest is to transform the way students prepare 
                for their future by making learning practical, accessible, 
                and career-focused. We believe education should go beyond theory 
                and help learners build real-world skills, confidence, and adaptability 
                in a rapidly evolving digital world. SkillNest aims to create a modern learning 
                ecosystem where technology meets opportunity, empowering every student 
                to turn ambition into achievement. 🚀

We believe knowledge becomes more powerful when it is shared, applied, and transformed into real-world skills that help individuals achieve their goals and build meaningful careers.
